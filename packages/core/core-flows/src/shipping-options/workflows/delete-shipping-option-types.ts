 * This workflow deletes one or more shipping-option types. It's used by the
 * [Delete Shipping Option Types Admin API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-option-types_deleteshippingoptiontypesid).
 *
 * This workflow has a hook that allows you to perform custom actions after the shipping-option types are deleted. For example,
 * you can delete custom records linked to the shipping-option types.
 *
 * You can also use this workflow within your own custom workflows, allowing you to wrap custom logic around shipping option type deletion.
 * 
 * @since 2.10.0
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await deleteShippingOptionTypesWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     ids: ["sotype_123"],
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Delete one or more shipping option types.
 *
 * @property hooks.shippingOptionTypesDeleted - This hook is executed after the types are deleted. You can consume this hook to perform custom actions on the deleted types.
