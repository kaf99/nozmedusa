Welcome to Medusa UI, a React implementation of the Medusa design system.

Medusa UI is a collection of components, hooks, utility functions, icons, and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes that can be used to build
a consistent user interface across the Medusa Admin and client applications.

## Packages

  in Medusa UI.
- `@medusajs/ui-preset` - Tailwind CSS preset containing all the classes
  used in Medusa UI.
- `@medusajs/icons` - Icons used in Medusa UI.

Learn how to install and use these packages either for [Medusa Admin](./installation/medusa-admin-extension/page.mdx) customizations or a [standalone project](./installation/standalone-project/page.mdx).

## How Medusa UI is Built

At its core, Medusa UI is a styled and slightly opinionated implementation of [Radix Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives).
Our team has also referenced the fantastic [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for inspiration in certain implementations.

Our team strongly believes in keeping the components simple and
composable, much like Medusa's foundation. This allows you to build whatever you need.

Our team has tried to avoid overloading
the component API and, instead, has leveraged the native HTML API, which gets implemented
and respected accordingly, and passed to the underlying elements.
