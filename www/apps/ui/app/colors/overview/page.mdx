In this guide, you'll learn about the color classes available in Medusa UI and how to use them.

## Overview

Medusa UI provides Tailwind CSS classes for colors from the Medusa design system. These classes can be used to style components and elements consistently across your Medusa and standalone applications.

To view the colors in the list below in dark mode, switch the documentation's theme from the menu in the top right.

To copy a color's Tailwind CSS class from the list below, click on it.

### How to Use the Medusa UI Colors

You can use the color classes in your Medusa Admin customizations or standalone projects that have the `@medusajs/ui` package installed.

You can apply the color classes as CSS classes to any element.

For example, to set the background color of the document's body:

```tsx
<body className="bg-medusa-bg-base">
  ...
</body>
```
