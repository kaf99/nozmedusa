In this guide, you'll learn how to install and use Medusa UI icons.

The Medusa UI icons package is a collection of React icon components from Medusa's design system. You can use these icons either in your Medusa Admin customizations, or in your standalone React projects.

## Installation

The Medusa UI icons package is available by default in your Medusa application, so you can use them in your Medusa Admin customizations without any additional installation steps.

### Installation in Standalone Projects

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      text: "React 16.8+ installed in your project.",
      link: "https://react.dev/",
    }
  ]}
/>

To install the Medusa UI icons package in your React-based project, run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/icons
```

## Usage

You can import and use the icons in your React components:

```tsx
import { Sun } from "@medusajs/icons"

export default function Component() {
  return (
    <Sun />
  )
}
```

## Icon Props

Icons accept all props that an `svg` element accepts.

### Icon Color

By default, outline icons' stroke color and solid icon's fill color are set to `currentColor`.

You can set a different color by passing the `color` prop.

<ComponentExample name="icon-color" />

You can also use a CSS class by passing the `className` prop.

<ComponentExample name="icon-color-classes" />

### Icon Size

All icon's width and height are `20px` and it's not possible to change them.
