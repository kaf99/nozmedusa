In this chapter, you'll learn how to use a step multiple times in a workflow.

## Problem Reusing a Step in a Workflow

In some cases, you may need to use a step multiple times in the same workflow.

The most common example is using the `useQueryGraphStep` multiple times in a workflow to retrieve multiple unrelated data, such as customers and products.

Steps must have a unique ID, which you pass as the first parameter of the `createStep` function.

```ts
const useQueryGraphStep = createStep(
  "use-query-graph"
  // ...
)
```

So, when a step is used multiple times in a workflow, it's registered multiple times in the workflow with the same ID, which causes an error.

```ts
const helloWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello",
  () => {
    const { data: products } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "product",
      fields: ["id"],
    })

    // ERROR OCCURS HERE: A STEP HAS THE SAME ID AS ANOTHER IN THE WORKFLOW
    const { data: customers } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "customer",
      fields: ["id"],
    })
  }
)
```

The next section explains how to fix this issue to use the same step multiple times in a workflow.

## How to Use a Step Multiple Times in a Workflow?

When you execute a step in a workflow, you can chain a `config` method to it to change the step's config.

Use the `config` method to change a step's ID for a single execution.

For example, this is the correct way to write the example above:

export const highlights = [
  ["13", "name", "Change the step's ID for this execution."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
const helloWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello",
  () => {
    const { data: products } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "product",
      fields: ["id"],
    })

    // âœ“ No error occurs, the step has a different ID.
    const { data: customers } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "customer",
      fields: ["id"],
    }).config({ name: "fetch-customers" })
  }
)
```

The `config` method accepts an object with a `name` property. Its value is the new ID for the step to use for this execution only.

The first `useQueryGraphStep` usage has the ID `use-query-graph`, and the second `useQueryGraphStep` usage has the ID `fetch-customers`.
