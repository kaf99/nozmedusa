# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn how to retrieve cart totals in your Medusa application using [Query](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query).

You may need to retrieve cart totals in your Medusa customizations, such as workflows or custom API routes, to perform custom actions with them. The ideal way to retrieve totals is with Query.

Refer to the [Retrieve Cart Totals in Storefront](../../../storefront-development/cart/totals/page.mdx) guide for a storefront-specific approach.

## How to Retrieve Cart Totals with Query

To retrieve cart totals, you mainly need to pass the `total` field within the `fields` option of the Query. This will return the cart's grand total, along with the totals of its line items and shipping methods. You can also pass additional total fields that you need for your use case.

For example, to retrieve all totals of a cart:

<Note title="Tip">

Use `useQueryGraphStep` in workflows, and `query.graph` in custom API routes, scheduled jobs, and subscribers.

## Caveats of Retrieving Cart Totals

### Using Asterisk (*) in Cart's Query

Cart totals are calculated based on the cart's line items, shipping methods, taxes, and any discounts applied. They are not stored in the `Cart` data model.

For that reason, you cannot retrieve cart totals by passing `*` to the Query's fields. For example, the following query will not return cart totals:

<CodeTabs group="query-type">
  <CodeTab label="useQueryGraphStep" value="useQueryGraphStep">

```ts
const { data: carts } = useQueryGraphStep({
  entity: "cart",
  fields: ["*"],
  filters: {
    id: "cart_123",
  },
})

// carts don't include cart totals
```
  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="query.graph" value="query.graph">

```ts
const { data: [cart] } = await query.graph({
  entity: "cart",
  fields: ["*"],
  filters: {
    id: "cart_123",
  },
})

// cart doesn't include cart totals
```
  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

This will return the cart data stored in the database, but not the calculated totals.

You also can't pass `*` along with `total` in the Query's fields option. Passing `*` will override the `total` field, and you will not retrieve cart totals. For example, the following query will not return cart totals:

<CodeTabs group="query-type">
  <CodeTab label="useQueryGraphStep" value="useQueryGraphStep">

```ts
const { data: carts } = useQueryGraphStep({
  entity: "cart",
  fields: ["*", "total"],
  filters: {
    id: "cart_123",
  },
})

// carts don't include cart totals
```
  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="query.graph" value="query.graph">

```ts
const { data: [cart] } = await query.graph({
  entity: "cart",
  fields: ["*", "total"],
  filters: {
    id: "cart_123",
  },
})

// cart doesn't include cart totals
```
  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Instead, when you need to retrieve cart totals, explicitly pass the `total` field in the Query's fields option, as shown in [the previous section](#how-to-retrieve-cart-totals-with-query). You can also include other fields and relations you need, such as `email` and `items.*`.

### Applying Filters on Cart Totals

You can't apply filters directly on the cart totals, as they are not stored in the `Cart` data model. You can still filter the cart based on its properties, such as `id`, `email`, or `currency_code`, but not on the calculated totals.
