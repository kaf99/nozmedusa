In this document, youâ€™ll learn about the main concepts in the Pricing Module.

## Price Data Model

The [Price](/references/pricing/models/Price) data model represents a specific price for a resource. For example, the price of a product variant in the USD currency.

The `Price` data model has an `amount` property that represents the monetary value of the price. It's stored as an integer in base units. For example, `$20.00` is stored as `20`.

The `Price` data model belongs to other data models like `PriceSet` and `PriceList` to provide a variety of pricing features, as explained below.

## Price Set

A [PriceSet](/references/pricing/models/PriceSet) represents a collection of prices that are linked to a resource (for example, a product variant or a shipping option).

Each of these prices is represented by the [Price data model](/references/pricing/models/Price).

## Price List

A [PriceList](/references/pricing/models/PriceList) is a group of prices only enabled if their conditions and rules are satisfied.

A price list has optional `start_date` and `end_date` properties that indicate the date range in which a price list can be applied.

Its associated prices are represented by the `Price` data model.
