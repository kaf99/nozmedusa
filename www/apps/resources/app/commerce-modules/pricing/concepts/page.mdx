In this guide, youâ€™ll learn about the main concepts in the Pricing Module.

## Price Data Model

The [Price](/references/pricing/models/Price) data model represents a specific price for a resource. For example, the price of a product variant in the USD currency.

The `Price` data model has an `amount` property that represents the monetary value of the price. It's stored as an integer in base or major units. For example, `$20.00` is stored as `20`, and `$20.5` is stored as `20.5`.

The `Price` data model belongs to other data models like `PriceSet` and `PriceList` to provide a variety of pricing features, as explained below.

## Price Set

A [PriceSet](/references/pricing/models/PriceSet) represents a collection of prices that are linked to a resource. For example, a product variant can have a price set that includes prices in multiple currencies, such as USD and EUR.

Each of these prices is represented by the [Price data model](#price-data-model).

## Price List

A [PriceList](/references/pricing/models/PriceList) is a group of prices that are only enabled when their conditions and rules are satisfied. For example, you can apply special prices to customers in the VIP group.

When the conditions are met, the prices in the price list can override the default prices in a price set. Learn more in the [Price Calculation](../price-calculation/page.mdx) guide.

A price list has optional `start_date` and `end_date` properties that indicate the date range in which a price list can be applied.

Its associated prices are represented by the [Price data model](#price-data-model).
