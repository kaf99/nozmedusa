# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn how to retrieve order totals in your Medusa application using [Query](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/module-links/query).

You may need to retrieve order totals in your Medusa customizations, such as workflows or custom API routes, to perform custom actions with them. The ideal way to retrieve totals is using Query.

## How to Retrieve Order Totals with Query

To retrieve order totals, you mainly need to pass the `total` field within the `fields` option of the Query. This will return the order's grand total, along with the totals of its line items and shipping methods. You can also pass additional total fields that you need for your use case.

For example, to retrieve all totals of an order:

<Note title="Tip">

Use `useQueryGraphStep` in workflows, and `query.graph` in custom API routes, scheduled jobs, and subscribers.

## Caveats of Retrieving Order Totals

### Using Asterisk (*) in Order Query

Order totals are calculated based on the order's line items, shipping methods, taxes, and any discounts applied. They are not stored in the `Order` data model.

For that reason, you cannot retrieve order totals by passing `*` to the Query's fields. For example, the following query will not return order totals:

<CodeTabs group="query-type">
  <CodeTab label="useQueryGraphStep" value="useQueryGraphStep">

```ts
const { data: orders } = useQueryGraphStep({
  entity: "order",
  fields: ["*"],
  filters: {
    id: "order_123",
  },
})

// orders don't include order totals
```
  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="query.graph" value="query.graph">

```ts
const { data: [order] } = await query.graph({
  entity: "order",
  fields: ["*"],
  filters: {
    id: "order_123",
  },
})

// order doesn't include order totals
```
  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

This will return the order data stored in the database, but not the calculated totals.

You also can't pass `*` along with `total` in the Query's fields option. Passing `*` will override the `total` field, and you will not retrieve order totals. For example, the following query will not return order totals:

<CodeTabs group="query-type">
  <CodeTab label="useQueryGraphStep" value="useQueryGraphStep">

```ts
const { data: orders } = useQueryGraphStep({
  entity: "order",
  fields: ["*", "total"],
  filters: {
    id: "order_123",
  },
})

// orders don't include order totals
```
  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="query.graph" value="query.graph">

```ts
const { data: [order] } = await query.graph({
  entity: "order",
  fields: ["*", "total"],
  filters: {
    id: "order_123",
  },
})

// order doesn't include order totals
```
  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

Instead, when you need to retrieve order totals, explicitly pass the `total` field in the Query's fields option, as shown in [the previous section](#how-to-retrieve-order-totals-with-query). You can also include other fields and relations you need, such as `email` and `items.*`.

### Applying Filters on Order Totals

You can't apply filters directly on the order totals, as they are not stored in the `Order` data model. You can still filter the order based on its properties, such as `id`, `email`, or `currency_code`, but not on the calculated totals.
