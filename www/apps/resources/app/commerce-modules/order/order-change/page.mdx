In this document, you'll learn what an order change is and the related concepts.

## OrderChange Data Model

The [OrderChange data model](/references/order/models/OrderChange) represents any kind of change to an order, such as a [return](../return/page.mdx), [exchange](../exchange/page.mdx), or [edit](../edit/page.mdx). Each of these is essentially an order change that is confirmed to apply changes to the original order.

The `OrderChange` model's `change_type` property indicates the purpose of the order change:

1. `edit`: The order change is making edits to the order, as explained in the [Order Edit](../edit/page.mdx) guide.
2. `exchange`: The order change is associated with an exchange, which you can learn about in the [Order Exchange](../exchange/page.mdx) guide.
3. `claim`: The order change is associated with a claim, which you can learn about in the [Order Claim](../claim/page.mdx) guide.
4. `return_request` or `return_receive`: The order change is associated with a return, which you can learn about in the [Order Return](../return/page.mdx) guide.

Once the order change is confirmed, its changes are applied to the order.

## Order Change Actions

The actions performed on the original order by an order change, such as adding an item, are represented by the [OrderChangeAction data model](/references/order/models/OrderChangeAction).

The `OrderChangeAction` has an `action` property that indicates the type of action to perform on the order, and a `details` property that holds additional information related to the action.

The following table lists the possible `action` values that Medusa uses and the corresponding `details` they carry.
