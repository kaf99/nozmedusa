## What is the Draft Orders Plugin?

The Draft Orders Plugin is a Medusa plugin that allows admin users to create and manage draft orders on behalf of customers from the Medusa Admin.

The Medusa application already has the foundation to support draft orders, including data models and API routes. This plugin adds a user interface for managing draft orders in the Medusa Admin dashboard.

The Draft Orders Plugin is especially useful for handling customer support scenarios or when a customer places an order offline, such as over the phone or in-store.

/>

To install the Draft Orders Plugin:

1. Run the following command in your Medusa application's directory:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @medusajs/draft-order
```

2. Add the plugin to your `medusa-config.ts` file:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/draft-order",
      options: {},
    },
  ],
})
```

### Test the Draft Orders Plugin

## How Draft Orders Work

A draft order is stored in the database as a regular order. It is represented by the [Order data model](/references/order/models/Order) with the following properties:

- `status`: Set to `draft` to indicate that the order is a draft.
- `is_draft_order`: Set to `true` to indicate that the order is a draft order.

So, the same [order concepts](../concepts/page.mdx) apply to draft orders as well.

### Editing Draft Orders

Similar to regular orders, draft orders can be [edited](../edit/page.mdx), allowing admin users to add, update, or remove items, as well as add shipping methods.

When the order edit is confirmed on the draft order, the changes are applied directly to the draft order and its [version](../order-versioning/page.mdx) is incremented.

### Converting Draft Orders to Regular Orders

Once a draft order is finalized and ready for processing, it can be converted to a regular order. This involves:

- Changing its `status` property to `pending`.
- Changing its `is_draft_order` property to `false`.

Admin users can then manage the order like any other regular order, including processing payments and fulfilling items.
