In this document, you’ll learn about orders and related concepts

## Order

An order is a purchase made by a customer, either through the storefront or through the API. It is represented by the [Order data model](/references/order/models/Order).

An order holds information about:

- The purchased items.
- The customer who made the order.
    - This is stored and handled by the [Customer Module](../../customer/page.mdx).
- Payment and shipping information

## Order Items

The items purchased in an order are represented by the [OrderItem data model](/references/order/models/OrderItem). An order can have multiple items.

### Item’s Product Details

The details of the purchased products are represented by the [LineItem data model](/references/order/models/OrderLineItem). Not only does a line item hold the details of the product, but also details related to its price, adjustments due to promotions, and taxes.

## Order’s Shipping Method

An order has one or more shipping methods used to handle item shipment.

Each shipping method is represented by the [OrderShippingMethod data model](/references/order/models/OrderShippingMethod) that holds its details. The shipping method is linked to the order through the [OrderShipping data model](/references/order/models/OrderShipping).

### data Property

When fulfilling an order, you can use a third-party fulfillment provider that requires additional custom data to be passed along from the order creation process.

The `OrderShippingMethod` data model has a `data` property. It’s an object used to store custom data relevant later for fulfillment.

The Medusa application passes the `data` property to the Fulfillment Module when fulfilling items.

## Order Totals

An order’s total amounts (including tax total, total after an item is returned, etc…) are represented by the [OrderSummary data model](/references/order/models/OrderSummary).

Refer to the [Retrieve Order Totals](../order-totals/page.mdx) guide to learn how to retrieve an order’s totals.

---

## Order Payments

Payments made on an order, whether they’re capture or refund payments, are recorded as transactions represented by the [OrderTransaction data model](/references/order/models/OrderTransaction).

An order can have multiple transactions. The sum of these transactions must be equal to the order summary’s total. Otherwise, there’s an outstanding amount.

Refer to the [Transactions](../transactions/page.mdx) guide to learn more.
