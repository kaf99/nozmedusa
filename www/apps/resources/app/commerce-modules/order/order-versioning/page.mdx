In this document, youâ€™ll learn how orders and their details are versioned.

## What is Order Versioning?

Versioning means assigning a version number to a record, such as an order and its items. This is useful for viewing the different versions of an order following changes throughout its lifetime.

When changes are confirmed on an order, such as when an item is added or returned, the order's version changes.

## version Property

The `Order` and `OrderSummary` data models have a `version` property that indicates the current version. By default, its value is `1`.

Other order-related data models, such as `OrderItem`, also have a `version` property, but it indicates the version to which the record belongs.

## How the Version Changes

When the order is changed, such as when an item is exchanged, Medusa updates the order's version and its related data:

1. The version of the order and its summary is incremented.
2. Related order data that have a `version` property, such as `OrderItem`, are duplicated. The duplicated item has the new version, while the original item retains the previous version.

When the order is retrieved, only the related data with the same version is returned.
