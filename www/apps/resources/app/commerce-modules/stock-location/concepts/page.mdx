In this guide, youâ€™ll learn about the main concepts in the Stock Location Module.

## Stock Location

A stock location, represented by the [StockLocation data model](/references/stock-location-next/models/StockLocation), represents a location where stock items are kept. For example, a warehouse.

Medusa uses stock locations to provide inventory details, stored and managed by the [Inventory Module](../../inventory/concepts/page.mdx), per location.

## StockLocationAddress

The [StockLocationAddress data model](/references/stock-location-next/models/StockLocationAddress) belongs to the `StockLocation` data model. It provides more detailed information about the location, such as country code or street address.
