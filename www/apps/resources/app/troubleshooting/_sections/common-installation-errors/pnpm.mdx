If you use `pnpm` as a package manager in your Medusa application, you might face errors about missing packages. For example:

```bash
can't resolve @medusajs/dashboard
```

## Why This Error Occurred

Medusa doesn't officially support `pnpm` as a package manager, which may lead to unexpected errors, including issues with package resolution.

---

## How to Fix it

To resolve this error and other potential errors, consider switching to `yarn` as your package manager.

If you still want to use `pnpm`, you must manually install the following packages in your project:

```bash
pnpm add @medusajs/dashboard @medusajs/icons @meduasjs/types @medusajs/draft-order @medusajs/ui
```

Make sure to also update these packages whenever you update your Medusa application.
