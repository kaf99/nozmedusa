# {metadata.title}

This section of the documentation provides a reference to the methods generated for services extending the service factory (`MedusaService`) and how to use them.

<Note title="Tip">

Refer to the [Service Factory](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules/service-factory) documentation to learn more.

## Method Names

When your module's main service extends the service factory, Medusa will:

1. Generate data-management methods in your main service for each of the data models passed to the `MedusaService` function.
2. Generate internal services for each of the data models passed to the `MedusaService` function, which can be resolved in loaders.

### Main Service Methods

The names of the generated methods for a service extending the service factory are of the format `{operationName}_{dataModelName}`, where:

- `{operationName}` is the name of the operation. For example, `create`.
- `{dataModelName}` is the pascal-case version of the data model's key that's passed in the object parameter of `MedusaService`. The name is pluralized for all operations except the `retrieve` operation.

Some examples of method names:

- `createPosts`
- `createMyPosts`
- `retrievePost`
- `listPosts`

### Internal Generated Service Methods

The internal services are useful when you need to perform database operations in loaders, as they're executed before the module's services are registered. Learn more in the [Module Container](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules/container) documentation.

For the internal services, the method names are only the operation name, without the data model name.

For example, a `Post` data model would have a `postService` with methods like `create`, `retrieve`, `update`, and `delete`.

## Methods Reference

<Note>

The reference uses only the operation name to refer to the method.
