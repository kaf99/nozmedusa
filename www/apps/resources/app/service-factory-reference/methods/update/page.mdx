# {metadata.title}

This method of a module's service updates one or more records.

The method's name is `updateDataModel`, where `DataModel` is the plural pascal-case name of the data model.

## Update One Record

```ts
const post = await postModuleService.updatePosts({
  id: "123",
  name: "My Post",
})
```

### Parameters

To update one record, pass an object that has at least an `id` property, identifying the ID of the record to update.

You can pass in the same object any other properties to update.

### Returns

The method returns the updated record as an object.

---

## Update Multiple Records

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.updatePosts([
  {
    id: "123",
    name: "My Post",
  },
  {
    id: "321",
    published_at: new Date(),
  },
])
```

### Parameters

To update multiple records, pass an array of objects. Each object must have at least an `id` property, identifying the ID of the record to update.

You can pass in each object any other properties to update.

### Returns

The method returns an array of updated record objects.

## Update Records Matching a Filter

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.updatePosts({
  selector: {
    name: "My Post",
  },
  data: {
    published_at: new Date(),
  },
})
```

### Parameters

To update records that match specified filters, pass an object with two properties as a parameter:

- `selector`: An object of filters that a record must match to be updated.
- `data`: An object of the properties to update in every record that match the filters in `selector`.

In the example above, you update the `published_at` property of every post record whose name is `My Post`.

<Note>

Refer to the [Filtering](../../tips/filtering/page.mdx) reference for more information on accepted filters and examples.

</Note>

### Returns

The method returns an array of updated record objects.

---

## Multiple Record Updates with Filters

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.updatePosts([
  {
    selector: {
      name: "My Post",
    },
    data: {
      published_at: new Date(),
    },
  },
  {
    selector: {
      name: "Another Post",
    },
    data: {
      metadata: {
        external_id: "123",
      },
    },
  },
])
```

### Parameters

To update records matching different sets of filters, pass an array of objects, each having two properties:

- `selector`: An object of filters that a record must match to be updated.
- `data`: An object of the properties to update in every record that match the filters in `selector`.

In the example above, you update the `published_at` property of post records whose name is `My Post`, and update the `metadata` property of post records whose name is `Another Post`.

<Note>

Refer to the [Filtering](../../tips/filtering/page.mdx) reference for more information on accepted filters and examples.

</Note>

### Returns

The method returns an array of updated record objects.

## Update a JSON Property

export const highlights = [
  ["4", "metadata", "`metadata` is a JSON property."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
const post = await postModuleService.updatePosts({
  id: "123",
  name: "My Post",
  metadata: {
    category: "news",
    tags: ["update", "json"],
  },
})
```

When you have a [JSON property](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/data-models/json-properties) in your data model, you can update it by adding, updating, or removing properties within that JSON object. Medusa will merge the properties you pass in the `update` method with the existing JSON object.

### Remove a Property from the JSON Property

```ts highlights={highlights}
const post = await postModuleService.updatePosts({
  id: "123",
  name: "My Post",
  metadata: {
    is_featured: "",
  },
})
```

To remove a property from the JSON object, you can set its value to an empty string.

### Learn More about Updating JSON Properties

Refer to the [JSON Properties](!docs!/learn/fundamentals/data-models/json-properties) documentation to learn more about how JSON properties work in Medusa and how to update them.
