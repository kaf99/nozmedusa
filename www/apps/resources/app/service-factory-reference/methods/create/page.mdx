export const metadata = {

# {metadata.title}

This method of a module's service creates one or more records of a data model.

The method's name is of the format `createDataModel`, where `DataModel` is the plural pascal-case name of the data model.

## Create One Record

```ts
const post = await postModuleService.createPosts({
  name: "My Post",
  published_at: new Date(),
  metadata: {
     external_id: "1234",
  },
})
```

If an object is passed to the method, the created record object is returned.

## Create Multiple Records

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.createPosts([
  {
    name: "My Post",
    published_at: new Date(),
  },
  {
    name: "My Other Post",
    published_at: new Date(),
  },
])
```

If an array of objects is passed to the method, an array containing the created records is returned.
