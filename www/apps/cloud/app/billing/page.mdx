In this guide, you'll learn how billing works in Cloud, and how to view and download invoices.

## How Billing Works

Medusa bills your organization monthly. 

Your monthly invoice contains:  

- An upfront charge for the plan you are currently on.
- An upfront charge for the add-ons you have.
- Pro-rated charges for the add-ons you added in the previous billing cycle.
- Charges for your [Flex Usage](../usage/page.mdx#what-is-flex-usage) in the previous billing cycle.

If your organization goes over its plan's usage limits within the current billing period, charges for your [Flex Usage](../usage/page.mdx#what-is-flex-usage) will be added to your next invoice.

Learn how to monitor your organization's usage in the [Usage](../usage/page.mdx) guide.

## View Billing History and Invoices

You can view your payment history in the organization's settings, and download invoices for each payment.

To view your organization's billing history and invoices:

1. Make sure you're viewing the [correct organization's dashboard in Cloud](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization).
2. Click on the <InlineIcon Icon={ChevronUpDown} alt="switch organization" /> icon in the [organization switcher](../organizations/page.mdx#switch-organization) at the top left of the Cloud dashboard.
3. Choose "Organization Settings" from the dropdown.
4. Change to the "Invoices" settings from the sidebar.

This will show a table of your upcoming payment, including your plan's amount and flex charges.

You can also see a table with all the payments made for your organization, including the date, status, and amount of each payment.

### Download Invoice

To download an invoice for a specific payment, click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowDownTray} alt="download" /> icon in the same row as the payment you want to download.

This will open the invoice in a new tab, where you can view and download it as a PDF.

## Purchase Add-On Resources

Your organization can purchase additional resources beyond its plan's limits as add-ons. For example, you can purchase additional user seats or environments.

You can purchase an add-on resource as you're creating that resource. For example, if you're creating a new project and you've already reached your plan's limit for projects, you'll see a note indicating that this project will be billed as an add-on.

Add-ons are billed monthly in advance, and they are pro-rated based on the number of days remaining in the month when you purchase them.

For example, if you purchase a $10 Preview Environment halfway through the month, you'll be charged $5 (pro-rated) for usage in the previous billing cycle and $10 upfront for usage in the next.

### How can I know if I'm being charged for an add-on?

When you're creating a resource that exceeds your plan's limits, such as a project or user seat, look for a note indicating that you'll be charged an additional amount for that resource.

For example, you may see a note saying "Creating an additional project adds $X to your bill."

### Where can I view my add-ons?

You can view your add-on charges in the [Invoices](#view-billing-history-and-invoices) section of your organization's settings. The add-on charges will be included in the "Upcoming Payments" table.

## Change Plan

You choose your organization's plan when you sign up for Cloud. However, the plan may not be the best fit for your needs as your business grows.

If you want to change your plan, or learn more about your plan's resources and limits, contact support for assistance.

## Handle Unsuccessful Payments

If a payment for your organization's subscription fails, you'll receive a [notification](../notifications/page.mdx) in the Cloud dashboard.

The payment may fail for various reasons, such as insufficient funds, an expired card, or other issues with the payment method. Make sure to [update your payment method](./manage/page.mdx#manage-payment-methods) if needed.

If there are no issues with your payment method and the payment still fails, contact support for assistance.

## Cancelling your Organization's Plan

You can cancel your organization's plan at any time. The plan will be cancelled at the end of the current billing period, and you will be charged for the month's plan and Flex Usage.

To cancel your organization's plan, contact support for assistance.
