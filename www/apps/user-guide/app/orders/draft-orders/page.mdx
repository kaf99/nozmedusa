<Note title="Prerequisite">

If you're using a version earlier than v2.10.0, you must [install the Draft Orders Plugin manually](!resources!/commerce-modules/order/draft-orders). Your technical team should handle the plugin installation.

</Note>

The Draft Orders section of the Medusa Admin allows you to create and manage draft orders on behalf of customers.

Draft orders are useful for handling customer support scenarios or when a customer places an order offline, such as over the phone or in-store.

You can view the list of available draft orders in your commerce store by clicking on Orders -> Drafts from the sidebar menu.

In the list, you can see draft order details such as the ID, date, customer, sales channel, and region. You can also search, filter, and sort the orders to find the specific draft order you are looking for.
