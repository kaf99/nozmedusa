# Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problem
The order list page was experiencing an infinite render loop when loading with filter parameters in the URL. The render count was climbing rapidly (178-193) and `parseFilterState` was returning empty objects despite having filter params.

## Root Causes
1. **Unstable dependencies**: `useQueryParams` was creating new objects on every render
2. **Race condition**: DataTable was trying to parse filter params before filters were provided
3. **Duplicate state updates**: Filter changes were triggering updates even when values hadn't changed
4. **Calling onConfigurationChange during render**: This could trigger parent re-renders

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Stabilized `useQueryParams` hook
- Added `useMemo` to prevent creating new objects on every render
- Used JSON.stringify for keys array to ensure stable dependency

### 2. Added guards to prevent parsing when filters aren't ready
- DataTable now checks if filters are provided before attempting to parse
- OrderListTable shows loading state until both columns and filters are ready

### 3. Prevented duplicate state updates
- `handleFilteringChange` now checks if filters actually changed before updating
- `handleSortingChange` also checks for actual changes
- This prevents infinite loops from identical updates

### 4. Deferred configuration change notifications
- Used `Promise.resolve().then()` to defer `onConfigurationChange` calls
- This avoids issues with React's render phase

### 5. Cleaned up debug logs
- Removed verbose logging that was added for debugging
- Kept only essential error logging

## Testing
After these changes, the order list page should:
1. Load without infinite loops when filter params are in the URL
2. Properly parse and display filters from URL params
3. Update URL params when filters change without causing loops
4. Show appropriate loading states while data is being fetched
